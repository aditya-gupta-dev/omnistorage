## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### GitHub App Setup

1. Create a new GitHub App in your organization settings
2. Configure webhook URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/github`
3. Set required permissions: Contents (Read/Write), Metadata (Read)
4. Generate and download private key

### PWA Customization

```javascript
// next.config.js
const withPWA = require('@ducanh2912/next-pwa')({
  dest: 'public',
  cacheOnFrontEndNav: true,
  aggressiveFrontEndNavCaching: true,
  reloadOnOnline: true,
  disable: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
});
```
